Introduction
This project involves automating the checkout process on the TutorialsNinja e-commerce website using Cypress. The primary objective is to create a Cypress script that automates the process of searching for a product, adding it to the cart, and completing the checkout process. This project demonstrates the use of Cypress for end-to-end testing and ensures that the checkout functionality works seamlessly.
